Deployment models for cloud computing:
1.cloud-based deployment:
	In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud,or you can design and build new applications in the cloud.
	Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
	Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
	Design and build new applications in the cloud.

2.On-premises deployment: is also known as a private cloud deployment. 
	In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
	Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
	Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

3.hybrid deployment:
	In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. 
You might want to use this approach in a number of situations.Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.

Benefits of cloud computing:
	Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
	Increase speed and agility
	Benefit from massive economies of scale

Types of cloud computing:

1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
	Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, 
computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.

2.Platform as a Service (PaaS):
	Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure and allow you to focus on the deployment 
and management of your applications.

3.Software as a Service (SaaS):
	Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
